# react-earthstar

Welcome! This is being figured out...

## Thinking out loud

I started this with the idea of creating a library of Earthstar hooks to help client authors build earthstar apps. But these clients are also nearly always going to need certain things like a way to sign in with an author keypair. Or create a title for a workspace where the hash is obscured, but visible if you hover over it.

I also started noticing that when using earthstar, I wanted to build little tools to use with myself and maybe one or two other people. Some of these applications are very specific, like a place to keep chat logs.

While I also want to enable the kind of client development we see with lobby and foyer — i.e. polished clients meant to be cloned, accessed and run by a wider audience — I also want to push along the development of 'good enough' clients that do a job for a small group who understands their needs well.

So there are now components in this library as well! The components will be unstyled, but I will add some hooks for being able to style them however you want (vanilla stylesheets, classnames etc.)
